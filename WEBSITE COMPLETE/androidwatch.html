<h1>Android Smart Watches</h1>
<p>Android Smart Watches are like a companion to your phone and in some cases take over the role of a phone quite well. <br>They feature always on displays so you'll always see messages/notifications etc. Some features don't even require your phone to be near you! As long as you have Wi-Fi that is.<br> They can also function as a pedometer and have many fitness apps available to assist your exercise regime.<br> Their high level of customization is probably their strongest suit</p>
